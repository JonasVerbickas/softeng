Dear mentors

We’d like to invite you to become a software engineering mentor at the University of Manchester. The dates and times this year are:

* Thursday 21st October at 11am (first session, meet your team)
* Thursday 18th November at 11am (second followup session with same team, track progress)

Registration and details are at https://software-eng.netlify.app/mentoring.html we’ve added a short video to explain the scheme to new mentors this year.

As with last year, the sessions will be online and you’ll be mentoring a team of ~7 students by doing some (gentle) code review as they write tests, fix bugs and add features to a large open source codebase.

This year, we’ve moved the students guidebook online too (see link above) so you can see more of what we’re teaching our students.

If you’re not able to attend, but know a colleague who would be interested, please feel free to forward this invite to them.

Any comments, suggestions and pull requests on the source material are welcome.

We look forward to hearing from you.

Best wishes

Duncan
(On behalf of the software engineering team)
